### Enabling robust offline active learning for machine learning potentials using simple physics-based priors

This repository houses the various experiments we ran as part of the corresponding manuscript. Additionally, we include several interactive Google Colab [notebooks](https://github.com/ulissigroup/Enabling-Robust-Offline-Active-Learning-for-MLPs/tree/master/interactive_notebooks) for users to play around with and explore. This repository is meant to be a submodule of the corresponding codebase - [amptorch](https://github.com/ulissigroup/amptorch/tree/active_learning). If you find this code or work useful in any way, please consider citing:
